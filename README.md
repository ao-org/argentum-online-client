## üê≤ Argentum Online Client üßô‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

Welcome to the source code repository for the Argentum Online Client. To fully utilize this client, you will need the corresponding server and assets:

- **Server:** [Argentum Online Server](https://github.com/ao-org/argentum-online-server)
- **Assets:** [Resources](https://github.com/ao-org/Recursos)

Important: Do not download the code using the "Download as ZIP" button on GitHub, as this can cause issues with file encoding and may corrupt some files. 

To download the code correctly, use a Git client. The command to clone the repository from the command line is:

```bash
git clone https://www.github.com/ao-org/argentum-online-client
```

## üêõ Report bugs
- **Please report the bugs in the Server repository to maintain all of the tickets in one place:** [Link](https://github.com/ao-org/Recursos](https://github.com/ao-org/argentum-online-server/issues))

## üõ°Ô∏è Contributing via Pull Requests

We encourage contributions to the project! However, to maintain code quality and readability, please adhere to our guidelines, especially when dealing with the peculiarities of Visual Basic 6 IDE, which tends to change variable names, complicating the review process for Pull Requests.

## üè† Localindex.dat
The [localindex.dat](https://github.com/ao-org/Recursos/blob/master/init/localindex.dat) file is generated by the following program: [argentum20-creador-indices](https://github.com/ao-org/argentum20-creador-indices). It is used to facilitate the reading of resource data on the client-side.

### ü™ù Setting Up Pre-commit Hooks

We utilize a pre-commit hook to minimize issues with variable name changes and other potential conflicts. Follow these steps to set up your environment correctly:

1. Open `git bash` or your preferred git client.
2. Execute the following commands:

```bash
chmod +x .githooks/pre-commit
git config core.hooksPath .githooks
```

Basically the pre-commit hook runs when you make a `git commit` and it will run the file `git_ignore_case.sh` to avoid false changes in the Pull Request. Is not perfect but it helps a lot. Please send the Pull Requests with only the neccesary code to be reviewed.

In case you have problems setting locally your pre-commit hook you can run the file `git_ignore_case.sh` by just doing double click.

This pre-commit hook executes the `git_ignore_case.sh` script during a `git commit`, helping to avoid false changes in Pull Requests. While it's not a perfect solution, it significantly aids in keeping our project clean and review-friendly.

### If You Encounter Issues

If you have any trouble setting up the pre-commit hook locally, you can manually run the `git_ignore_case.sh` script by double-clicking on it. This step ensures that your contributions are as clean and straightforward as possible.
